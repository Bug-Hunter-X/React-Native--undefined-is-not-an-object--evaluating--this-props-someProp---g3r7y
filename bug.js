This error occurs when you try to access a component's state or props before it has mounted.  This commonly happens within the component's constructor or during initial rendering.

```javascript
// Incorrect:
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    console.log(this.props.someProp); // Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'someProp')
    this.state = { ... };
  }
  render() { ... }
}
```

The `this.props` and `this.state` are not guaranteed to be populated until after the component has mounted.
